========================================


This project is a labor of love born out of compassion and just a touch of frustration. Every time I see a fellow game student in the labs using SVN, a small piece of me dies.

## Why Make This Doc?
The most common reason I hear people give for why they don't use git is that it is intimidating, especially to non-programmers. I understand where people are coming from on this, but I think git is powerful and flexible enough to make it worth overcoming the initial fear. Hopefully reading through this (and having the How-To references available whenever you need) will remove some of that fear.

## Who Is This Doc For?
It's primarily targeted at Champlain students, especially seniors entering Capstone in the fall. Git has the potential to improve productivity and tracking of your history, and this is especially valuable for Capstone. Being able to rapidly prototype on multiple branches while still keeping the size of your repository reasonable AND having a working branch at any given time is beyond useful. Hooking up Unity's SmartMerge with git (and especially with SourceTree) will allow you to merge many people's work together with ease. It makes the entire development process easier and smoother once you understand how to use it. 

That said, all of that applies to underclassmen at Champlain as well; this information will be incredibly useful to you next time you find yourself in a production or team environment where you have to work on a game with other people. Really, any collaborative project (except for things better made in Google Docs or Slides) can benefit from the use of git and version control.
